# MeetApp
This is my homework for the mobile development course at BME.

## Introduction
My application is a meeting organizer tool that helps find suitable times for group meetings.
The idea was inspired by the listed example applications and born from the need to simplify organizing meetings for multiple participants. We all know how challenging it can be to find a common time for even 3-4 people. The target audience includes anyone who wants to make it easier to decide on meeting times involving multiple participants.

## Key features
- Users can create various meetings by specifying a name and a defined time interval (within which participants must select a suitable time). Optionally, a description can also be added.
- Participants can be added to meetings. Within the specified interval, they can indicate whether a given day is suitable, not suitable, or maybe suitable for them.
- Meetings, participants, and their associated data are stored persistently.
- A bar chart provides a clear overview of how many participants find each day suitable for a given meeting.
